This project utilizes solar energy to generate electricity and store supply water for agricultural farms. We are using sensors in the system to control and notify the values of parameters like voltage, current, power etc. of the system. The data collected from sensors is passed over a server that stores all the values in its database.  The capability of IOT can help to limit the transportation and operation cost while still provide good outcomes in agriculture sector. In this project a cell phone and a server are utilized as IOT devices to gather the information through the implicit sensors used in the system. The mobile application and the server provides different functionality to user like various sensor values, location of the device, plotting different characteristic graphs like I-V graphs, P-V graphs for the parameter values obtained from the system. A user can inspect the system’s behavior by analyzing these graphs.
